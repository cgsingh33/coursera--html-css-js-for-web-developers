                    Salad is a ready-to-eat dish often containing leafy vegetables, usually served chilled or at a moderate temperature and often served with a sauce or dressing. Salads may also contain ingredients such as fruit, grain, meat, seafood and sweets. Though many
                    salads use raw ingredients, some use cooked ingredients.

                    ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted, forming a broth.
